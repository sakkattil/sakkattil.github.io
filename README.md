# Hi, call me sakattil 👋

I'm exploring biomedical engineering, medical devices, improving health-care systems, and bio-data projects.  
This site is a log of what I'm building and learning.

## 🚧 Projects
- **ECG Signal Analysis**: Using Python to process and analyze heart rate variability.
    - Using open-source ECG datasets to analyze heart rate variability
    - Writing Python code to extract and plot R-peaks
    - Goal: understand how real-world biosignals are used in health tracking
- **Arduino Fall Detector** *(in progress)*: A motion sensor project for health monitoring.
    - Designing a simple fall detection prototype using motion sensors
    - Will log motion data and trigger a warning when fall-like patterns are detected
- **Living Lab Rat Hospital** *(future)*: Hospital built on systems that promote efficient development and research.

## 📚 Learning Log
- *July 31:* Started reading “Wearable Biosensors: A Review.” Summarizing key mechanisms and use cases.
- *August 3:* Built my first breadboard circuit with Arduino.
